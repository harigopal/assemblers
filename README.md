What is this?
=============

Just backing up some code I'd written while I was at college. I'd placed these on a free text host site, where even copying code out didn't work properly. So I'm placing everything here. Apparantly, people still have some use for this stuff! Wow. :-|

I've updated [my blog post](http://harigopal.in/blog/?p=72) to point to this repository.

Hint
----

Both assemblers assume that the source is at "c:/cprogs/assemble.txt". Edit the file open statement and point it to input/assemble.s, wherever it is on your disk.

Just for reference
